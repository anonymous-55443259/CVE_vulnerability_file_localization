Description
Petr Matousek
          2012-08-20 17:16:24 UTC
An use-after-free flaw has been found in the way taskstat's TASKSTATS_CMD_ATTR_PID command and exiting tasks with already freed mm interacted. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or leak kernel memory.
Upstream fix:
