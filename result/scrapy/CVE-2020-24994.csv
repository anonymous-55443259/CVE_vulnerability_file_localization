I believe this is already fixed in the master branch (ironically, in one of the very first commits after the 0.14.0 release that you‚Äôre testing, namely 6835731, part of #296). Could you confirm this by building your libass from master?
We do need to make a new release though.

@stevebeattie: Hi, thanks for letting us know. I believe the description of this CVE is wrong; it states (emphasis mine): ‚ÄúStack overflow in the parse_tag function in libass/ass_parse.c in libass before 0.14.0‚Äù, but 6835731 only landed after 0.14.0 was released.

@TheOneric thanks, I've submitted correction information to MITRE, we'll see how long it takes them to update it.
(In an ideal world, you'd be able to file a github issue directly against https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist but they don't allow bug reports on the project.)

Thanks for taking your time to fuzz libass.
I can't find mystrcmp anywhere in the stacktrace, it seems to point towards the same problem as #422 , perhaps you mixed the stacktraces up? Did you fuzz against git-master or still 0.14.0 ?
Also the poc.zip archive seems to be broken, so unfortunately I can't try to reproduce it myself and it isn't obvious to me how mystrcmp can be exploited either.
Archive:  poc.zip
End-of-central-directory signature not found.  Either this file is not
a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.
Incidentially mystrcmp was modified a few days ago in b3f9022, could you retest and/or reupload the sample file ?

Ok, I've tested the file from the RAR archive with master and 0.14.0. In both cases I couldn't reproduce any overflows or similar.
Can you  provide exact steps how to reproduce this? Which program consumes the sample file? Which OS, libc and CPU architecture? Which exact version of libass is being used?

Unless the OP posted a wrong stack trace by accident, I‚Äôm pretty sure this is the same as #422 and is long fixed in master.
It‚Äôs great to have more people fuzz libass, but please run your tests against master!
