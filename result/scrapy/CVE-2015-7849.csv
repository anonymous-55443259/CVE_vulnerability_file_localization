Martin Prpič
          2015-10-22 11:30:01 UTC
The following flaw was found in ntpd:
An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the password management functionality of the Network Time Protocol. A specially crafted key file could cause a buffer overflow resulting in memory corruption. An attacker could provide a malicious password file to trigger this vulnerability.

October 2015 Network Time Protocol Daemon (ntpd) Vulnerabilities in Multiple NetApp Products

Overview:
Summary
Multiple NetAppÂ® products contain the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd). The Open NTP project (www.ntp.org) has released a Security Notice regarding vulnerabilities that affect versions before ntp-4.2.8p4. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to modify data, execute arbitrary code, cause a process crash or Denial of Service (DoS).
Impact
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead to data modification, arbitrary code execution, process crashes or Denial of Service (DoS).
Clustered Data ONTAP and Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode were only found to be affected by CVE-2015-5300, CVE-2015-7704, and CVE-2015-7705.

NTP BUG 2916: memory corruption in password store

Summary
Resolved
4.2.8p4
21 Oct 2015
References
Bug 2916
CVE-2015-7849
Affects
All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p4, and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77.
Resolved in 4.2.8p4.
CVSS2 Score
6.8, worst case
AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:C/A:C
Description
If ntpd is configured to allow remote configuration, and if the (possibly spoofed) source IP address is allowed to send remote configuration requests, and if the attacker knows the remote configuration password or if ntpd was configured to disable authentication, then an attacker can send a set of packets to ntpd that may cause a crash or theoretically perform a code injection attack.
Mitigation
Implement BCP-38.
Upgrade to 4.2.8p4 or later.
If you are unable to upgrade, remote configuration of NTF’s ntpd requires:
an explicitly configured “trusted” key. Only configure this if you need it.
access from permitted IP addresses. You choose the IPs.
authentication. Don’t disable it. Practice key security safety.
If you use ntpq in scripts, make sure ntpq does what you expect in your scripts.
