A vulnerability in the seccomp implementation prior to kernel version 4.8, identified as CVE-2019-2054, allows a local attacker to bypass seccomp restrictions. This vulnerability could lead to a local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. By exploiting this vulnerability, a local attacker could potentially bypass seccomp restrictions, enabling them to escalate their privileges within the context of a privileged process. This vulnerability affects the seccomp component of the kernel. The attack vector for this vulnerability involves a local attacker leveraging seccomp policies that allow the use of ptrace to bypass the intended restrictions. This vulnerability does not require user interaction for exploitation, making it a concerning security issue that could lead to unauthorized privilege escalation within the system.
