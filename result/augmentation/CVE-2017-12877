A use-after-free vulnerability in the DestroyImage function in ImageMagick before 7.0.6-6, as identified by CVE-2017-12877, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by exploiting a crafted file. This vulnerability can be triggered by an attacker manipulating a specific file, leading to a heap-use-after-free condition. The impact of this vulnerability is a potential crash or denial of service of the affected software. The vulnerable software components include the DestroyImage function in image.c within the ImageMagick software suite. Attack vectors that can make use of this vulnerability involve manipulating the input file to trigger the use-after-free condition in the DestroyImage function. The issue was discovered and reported by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo, and a fix has been implemented in version 7.0.6-6, as documented in the commit fix: https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/04178de2247e353fc095846784b9a10fefdbf890.
