A stack buffer overflow vulnerability in usrsctp in Firefox ESR < 68.8, Firefox < 76, and Thunderbird < 68.8.0 could be exploited by an attacker when parsing and validating SCTP chunks in WebRTC. This vulnerability could lead to memory corruption and potentially exploitable crashes. An attacker could craft a malicious SCTP chunk to trigger the buffer overflow, potentially allowing for remote code execution or denial of service attacks. This vulnerability poses a significant risk to the integrity and availability of affected systems.
