A vulnerability in versions of Gradio prior to 2.5.0 allows for unauthorized access to files on the host computer when a user creates and publicly shares Gradio interfaces. This vulnerability arises from unrestricted file paths, enabling individuals with a Gradio link to access any files on the host computer if they possess knowledge of the file names or paths. While the paths are opened in read-only mode, the impact of this vulnerability is significant as it exposes sensitive information to potential attackers. The issue has been addressed in gradio 2.5.0, where the file serving mechanism has been modified to prevent unauthorized access to host computer files.
