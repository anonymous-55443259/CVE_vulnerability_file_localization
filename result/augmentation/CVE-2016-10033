The vulnerability CVE-2016-10033 affects the PHPMailer library versions prior to 5.2.18 and allows for remote code execution. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into the "from" address of an email sent using the PHPMailer library. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the target web server. While Joomla versions up to 3.6.5 are affected by this vulnerability, the Joomla API has additional validations in place that prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability within the Joomla environment. However, extensions that use a separate version of PHPMailer or do not use the Joomla API for sending emails may still be vulnerable. The recommended solution is to update to PHPMailer version 5.2.20 or newer to mitigate this vulnerability. The exploit involves injecting a payload into the PHPMailer library via a contact form, which can upload a backdoor PHP file to the target server. This backdoor file can then be used to execute a reverse shell on the target server, allowing the attacker to gain control over the system.
