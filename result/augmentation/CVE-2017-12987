A buffer over-read vulnerability in the IEEE 802.11 parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2, specifically in print-802_11.c:parse_elements(), allows remote attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or cause a Denial of Service condition. This vulnerability could be exploited by a remote attacker sending specially crafted packets to a vulnerable system running an affected version of tcpdump. It is crucial for all tcpdump users to upgrade to version 4.9.2 or later to mitigate the risk of exploitation.
