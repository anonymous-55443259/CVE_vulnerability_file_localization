A format string vulnerability in the p_cgi_error function in the Python CGI Kit (neo_cgi) module for Clearsilver 0.10.5 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers that are not properly handled when creating CGI error messages using the cgi_error API function. By sending a specially-crafted input containing malicious format specifiers, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash. This vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.
