# VulFileHunter: Leveraging Key Aspect Augmentation with LLMs for Vulnerability-relevant File Uncovery

## code
The complete code is divided into multiple modules, and you can run main.py directly.

## dataset
- **cleaned_gt_commit_single_v2**: cve and all of files in the related patching commit. Format: {(cve_id, repo_name): [vulnerable files]}
- **cve_github_can**: {cve_id: commit links, pull links, issue links, other links}, each cve can have multiple commit/pull/issue/other links. Some of the commits may be further conducted from pull links & issue links. The files from conducted commit links are involved in gt_commit but the conducted commit links are not involved in cve_github_can. This file may contain noises, some of the other links are mixed into commit links, need further filtering
- **cve_metadata**: partial cve metadata, full data can be downloaded from https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds#JSON_FEED

## result
- **augmentation**: augmented description
- **commit**: collected commits, format: {cve_id : [(repo_name, commit_sha)]}
- **components**: extracted components
- **ground_truth**: include vulnerability-relevant files, patching commits, and the corresponding source file
- **localization**: vulnerability-relevant files rank list
- **repo_data**: relevant data when retrieving repositories and commits
- **repository**: collected repositories, format: {cve_id : [repo_name]}
- **retrieval**: candidate vulnerability-relevant files 
- **scrapy**: NVD link crawling results
